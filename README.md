Playground for data structures in JavaScript.
This is a child project of [@aureooms/js-library](https://github.com/make-github-pseudonymous-again/js-library)
and
the twin project of [@aureooms/js-algorithms](https://github.com/make-github-pseudonymous-again/js-algorithms).

## :newspaper: Description

This README regroups dozens of projects focusing on implementing data structures with JavaScript.
This project itself does not contain any code.
